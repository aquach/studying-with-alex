## How to run

1. `npm install`
2. `npm run test` to run tests.
3. `npm run -- input.txt out` to run the fully factored script.

The intermediate steps can be found in [non-factored.ts](non-factored.ts) and [first-factoring.ts](first-factoring.ts). You can run with them `npx ts-node non-factored.ts input.txt out`.
